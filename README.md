# Emacs-snazzy

> Elegant Emacs theme with bright colors


## Install

<!-- Add `snazzy-theme.el` to your `load-path` and add the following line to your `init.el` -->
1. Install `base16-theme` from MELPA.
2. Install `snazzy-theme.el` by running `M-x package-install-file` and point to the file.
3. Add the following line to your `init.el`.

```elisp
(load-theme 'snazzy t)
```

I am in the process of making a request to add this to the MELPA repository. Hopefully we won't have to install this manually in the future!

This color scheme is originally by [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com). I merely adapted his theme for Emacs and decided to share it for those who are looking for this color scheme for Emacs, as well as to learn to create my own Emacs package.


## Contributing
Since I did not create this color scheme, feel free to create a pull request to make it more closely resemble the original vision of the author.
